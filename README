after
=====

After the specified process dies, echo a string. (OpenBSD only).

Usage
-----

	after [-h] [-v] [-p pid | -n process_name] -e string

The process to watch is specified `-p pid' or `-n process_name'.
After this process dies the string specified by `-e string' will be printed
to standard output.

Examples
--------

The following are some examples to illustrate how after can be useful (or not).

Notify yourself when your build is done:

	$ after -n gcc -e "build is done!"

The power of this simple tool can be observed when it is piped into other
programs. For example, putting your machine to sleep after your update jobs
finish:

	$ after -p 2027 -e "doas zzz" | sh
