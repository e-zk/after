after
=====

After the specified process dies, echo a string. (OpenBSD only).

Usage
-----

	after [-h] [-v] [-p pid | -n process_name] -e string

The process to watch is specified `-p pid' or `-n process_name'.
After this process dies the string specified by `-e string' will be printed
to standard output.

Examples
--------

The following are some examples to illustrate how after can be useful (or not).

Notify yourself when your build is done:

	$ after -n gcc -e "build is done!"

The power of this simple command can be observed when it is piped into other processes.

Put your machine to sleep after your update jobs are complete:

	$ after -p 2027 -e "doas zzz" | sh
